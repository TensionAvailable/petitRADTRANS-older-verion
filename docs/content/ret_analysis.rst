OLD (from Molli√®re+19): Analysis of results
===========================================

Here we give some example code for how to analyse one's results after
having carried out a retrieval. Example code is given for posterior
corner plots and for temperature confidence envelopes. For the
calculation of spectra and contribution functions see the tutorial,
that is section `Getting started
<notebooks/getting_started.html>`_ (for the spectra) and the section on
`analysis tools
<notebooks/analysis.html>`_ (for the contribution functions).
