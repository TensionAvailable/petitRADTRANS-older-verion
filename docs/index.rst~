petitRADTRANS documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the **petitRADTRANS** documentation. petitRADTRANS is a
Python package for the calculating transmission and emission spectra
of exoplanets, at low (:math:`\lambda/\Delta\lambda=1000`) and high
(:math:`\lambda/\Delta\lambda=10^6`) resolution, for clear and cloudy
atmospheres.

.. important::
   Scattering is currently not included for
   emission spectra in petitRADTRANS (but it is for the transmission
   spectra). We intend to migrate the scattering implementation of
   `petitCODE <https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~molliere/#petitcode>`_
   to petitRADTRANS soon.

petitRADTRANS will be available under the MIT License, and documented in Mollière et al, in prep.
Until the documentation paper is published, please contact_ and invite Paul Mollière
as coauthor if you make use of petitRADTRANS in your work.
