class Data:
    """
    This class stores the spectral data to be retrieved from a single instrument or observation.

    Each dataset is associated with an instance of petitRadTrans and an atmospheric model.
    The pRT instance can be overwritten, and associated with an existing pRT instance with the
    external_pRT_reference parameter.
    This setup allows for joint or independant retrievals on multiple datasets.

    Args:
        name : str
            Identifier for this data set.
        path_to_observations : str
            Path to observations file, including filename. This can be a txt or dat file
            containing the wavelength, flux, transit depth and error, or a fits file
            containing the wavelength, spectrum and covariance matrix.
        distance : float
            The distance to the object in cgs units. Defaults to a 10pc normalized distance.
        data_resolution : float
            Spectral resolution of the instrument. Optional, allows convolution of model to
            instrumental line width.
        model_resolution : float
            Will be ``None`` by default.  The resolution of the c-k opacity tables in pRT.
            This will generate a new c-k table using exo-k. The default (and maximum)
            correlated k resolution in pRT is :math:`\lambda/\Delta \lambda > 1000` (R=500).
            Lowering the resolution will speed up the computation.
            If integer positive value, and if ``opacities == 'lbl'`` is ``True``, then this
            will sample the the high-resolution opacities at the specified resolution.
            This may be desired in the case where medium-resolution spectra are
            required with a :math:`\lambda/\Delta \lambda > 1000`, but much smaller than
            :math:`10^6`, which is the resolution of the ``lbl`` mode. In this case it
            may make sense to carry out the calculations with lbl_opacity_sampling = 10e5,
            for example, and then rebinning to the final desired resolution:
            this may save time! The user should verify whether this leads to
            solutions which are identical to the rebinned results of the fiducial
            :math:`10^6` resolution. If not, this parameter must not be used.
            Note the difference between this parameter and the lbl_opacity_sampling
            parameter in the RadTrans class - the actual desired resolution should
            be set here.
        external_pRT_instance : object
            An existing RadTrans object. Leave as none unless you're sure of what you're doing.
        model_generating_function : method
            A function, typically defined in run_definition.py that returns the model wavelength and spectrum (emission or transmission).
            This is the function that contains the physics of the model, and calls pRT in order to compute the spectrum.
        wlen_range_micron : tuple,list
            Set the wavelength range of the pRT object. Defaults to a range +/-5% greater than that of the data. Must at least be
            equal to the range of the data.
        scale : bool
            Turn on or off scaling the data by a constant factor. Set to True if scaling the data during the retrieval.
        wlen_bins : numpy.ndarray
            Set the wavelength bins to bin the pRT model to the data. Defaults to the data bins.
        photometry : bool
            Set to True if using photometric data.
        photometric_transformation_function : method
            Transform the photometry (account for filter transmission etc.).
            This function must take in the wavelength and flux of a spectrum,
            and output a single photometric point (and optionally flux error).
        photometric_bin_edges : Tuple, numpy.ndarray
            The edges of the photometric bin in micron. [low,high]
        opacity_mode : str
            Should the retrieval be run using correlated-k opacities (default, 'c-k'),
            or line by line ('lbl') opacities? If 'lbl' is selected, it is HIGHLY
            recommended to set the model_resolution parameter. In general,
            'c-k' mode is recommended for retrievals of everything other than
            high-resolution (R>40000) spectra.
